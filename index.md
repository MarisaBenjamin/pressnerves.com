## Welcome to Pressnerves.com

Here is where we share the stories we otherwise can't tell.

All stories are presented anonymously by default. We don't need to know who wrote them in order to know that these are worth reading.

### Get involved

Start by reading and thinking about these stories. If there's something you'd like to share, submit it through this google form. Your identity will be protected, unless you choose to reveal it.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/MarisaBenjamin/pressnerves.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
